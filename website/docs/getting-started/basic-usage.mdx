:::info
This example uses `uniforms-bridge-zod` and `uniforms-antd` packages as this bridge and theme don't require any extra configuration.
:::

### 1. Installation

First, install uniforms packages.

```sh
npm install uniforms uniforms-bridge-zod uniforms-antd
```

After that, we need also to install `zod` and `antd` packages.

```sh
npm install zod antd
```

### 2. Create a schema

Let's create a schema for our form. We will use `zod` package for this.

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

const userSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

const schema = new ZodBridge({ schema: userSchema });
```

### 3. Create a form

Now we can create a form. We will use `uniforms-antd` package for this.

```tsx
import { AutoForm } from 'uniforms-antd';

function App() {
  return <AutoForm schema={schema} onSubmit={console.log} />;
}
```

That's it! Now we can render our form and see it in action.

### Summary

We have created a simple form with a schema. It uses AntD theme and Zod as our schema validator. Check [advanced usage](/docs/gettings-started/advanced-usage) for more complex examples or play around with the example below.
