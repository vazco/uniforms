  - Include other versions as well, if you think it may help (React, browser, etc.).
- Steps to reproduce. If possible, include a reproduction using our [playground](https://uniforms.tools/playground) or [CodeSandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/vazco/uniforms/tree/master/reproductions).
