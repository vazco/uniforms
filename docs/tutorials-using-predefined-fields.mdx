import TutorialForm from '../website/scripts/components/TutorialForm';
import GuestFormProfessionAdditionalInfo from '../website/scripts/components/GuestFormProfessionAdditionalInfo.js';
import GuestFormPredefinedFields from '../website/scripts/components/GuestFormPredefinedFields.js';
import GuestFormWithFieldsInSchema from '../website/scripts/components/GuestFormWithFieldsInSchema.js';

Now that we know how to ask our guests for their name, let's ask them a few more things!
We can expect a lot of different people coming to our IT conference - they could be developers, testers, product owners, project managers, businessmen and so on.
Perhaps we want to calculate how many representatives of various professions will visit us?
Or maybe (if there are enough people) we want to prepare special, personalized events?
It would be also a decent idea to somehow gather their visions and expectations about the conference or any additional valuable information for the organizer.

Let's modify our schema by adding two new properties: `profession` and `additionalInfo` in order to have the additional fields rendered:

```js
const schema = {
  title: 'Guest',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    firstName: {type: 'string'},
    lastName: {type: 'string'},
    workExperience: {
      description: 'Work experience in years',
      type: 'integer',
      minimum: 0,
      maximum: 100
    },
    profession: {type: 'string'},
    additionalInfo: {type: 'string'}
  },
  required: ['firstName', 'lastName']
};
```

After the schema change, we must not forget to add the fields to our form.
We will add the `profession` field above the `workExperience` field and the `additionalInfo` at the bottom:

```js
import {AutoField, AutoForm, ErrorField, SubmitField} from 'uniforms-semantic';
import React from 'react';

import GuestSchema from './GuestSchema';

export default function GuestForm() {
  return (
    <AutoForm schema={GuestSchema} onSubmit={console.log}>
      <h4>IT meeting guest questionnaire</h4>
      <AutoField name="lastName" />
      <ErrorField name="lastName">
        <span>You have to provide your last name!</span>
      </ErrorField>
      <AutoField name="firstName" />
      <ErrorField name="firstName" errorMessage="You have to provide your first name!" />
      <span>Do you want to share your work experience with us?</span>
      <AutoField name="profession" />
      <AutoField name="workExperience" />
      <ErrorField
        name="workExperience"
        errorMessage="Your work experience cannot be lesser than 0 or greater than 100 years!"
      />
      <AutoField name="additionalInfo" />
      <SubmitField />
    </AutoForm>
  );
}
```

<TutorialForm>
  <GuestFormProfessionAdditionalInfo />
</TutorialForm>

Let's stop for a while and think of what we have. Obviously, we there is a form generated, but it's not quite what we've expected:

- The `profession` field is rendered a an ordinary text input, where anyone can type literally anything.
  It would be far better if it would be displayed as a selectable list of options.
- The `additionalInfo` property is supposed to store lots of text, so it's preffered to be displayed as a text area.

**We can handle it in two ways:**

1. By replacing the `AutoField` inside the `AutoForm` with a desired field.
2. By manipulating the schema using the `uniforms` key.

### 1. Replacing the `AutoField`

Uniforms provide a set of predefined out-of-the-box [fields](api-fields) that we can use instead of the `AutoField`.
The perfect one for a `profession` property is a `SelectField`. All we have to do to have it rendered is to provide the list of available options.
The same thing applies to the `additionalInfo` - in order to see it as a text area we can use the `LongTextField` component.
Let's see our changes in action:

```js
import {AutoField, AutoForm, ErrorField, LongTextField, SelectField, SubmitField} from 'uniforms-semantic';
import React from 'react';

import GuestSchema from './GuestSchema';

const professions = [
  {
    label: 'Developer',
    value: 'developer'
  },
  {
    label: 'Tester',
    value: 'tester'
  },
  {
    label: 'Product owner',
    value: 'product-owner'
  },
  {
    label: 'Project manager',
    value: 'project-manager'
  },
  {
    label: 'Businessman',
    value: 'businessman'
  }
];

export default function GuestForm({onSubmit}) {
  return (
    <AutoForm schema={GuestSchema} onSubmit={console.log}>
      <h4>IT meeting guest questionnaire</h4>
      <AutoField name="lastName" />
      <ErrorField name="lastName">
        <span>You have to provide your last name!</span>
      </ErrorField>
      <AutoField name="firstName" />
      <ErrorField name="firstName" errorMessage="You have to provide your first name!" />
      <span>Do you want to share your work experience with us?</span>
      <AutoField name="workExperience" />
      <ErrorField
        name="workExperience"
        errorMessage="Your work experience cannot be lesser than 0 or greater than 100 years!"
      />
      <AutoField name="profession" />
      <SelectField name="profession" options={professions} />
      <LongTextField name="additionalInfo" />
      <SubmitField />
    </AutoForm>
  );
}
```

<TutorialForm>
  <GuestFormPredefinedFields />
</TutorialForm>

As you can see, now we have a beautiful select field and a text area!

### 2. Manipulating the schema

Now that we know how to use predefined fields within the `AutoForm`, let's see how to do it in a more fancy way,
without the necessity to replace the `AutoField`. That means modifying our schema and shows true magic of the uniforms.

Before touching the schema, let's have a look at the React form first:

```js
import {AutoField, AutoForm, ErrorField, SubmitField} from 'uniforms-semantic';
import React from 'react';

import GuestSchema from './GuestSchema';

export default function GuestForm() {
  return (
    <AutoForm schema={GuestSchema} onSubmit={console.log}>
      <h4>IT meeting guest questionnaire</h4>
      <AutoField name="lastName" />
      <ErrorField name="lastName">
        <span>You have to provide your last name!</span>
      </ErrorField>
      <AutoField name="firstName" />
      <ErrorField name="firstName" errorMessage="You have to provide your first name!" />
      <span>Do you want to share your work experience with us?</span>
      <AutoField name="profession" />
      <AutoField name="workExperience" />
      <ErrorField
        name="workExperience"
        errorMessage="Your work experience cannot be lesser than 0 or greater than 100 years!"
      />
      <AutoField name="additionalInfo" />
      <SubmitField />
    </AutoForm>
  );
}
```

As you can see, both `SelectField` and `LongTextField` have been removed in favor of the `AutoField`.

Now we can focus on modifying the schema.
Instead of having to type the React component by ourselves inside our form, we can declare it inside the schema, thanks to the `uniforms` property, as it's demonstrated below:

```js
const schema = {
  title: 'Guest',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    firstName: {type: 'string'},
    lastName: {type: 'string'},
    workExperience: {
      description: 'Work experience in years',
      type: 'integer',
      minimum: 0,
      maximum: 100
    },
    profession: {
      type: 'string',
      options: [
        {
          label: 'Developer',
          value: 'developer'
        },
        {
          label: 'Tester',
          value: 'tester'
        },
        {
          label: 'Product owner',
          value: 'product-owner'
        },
        {
          label: 'Project manager',
          value: 'project-manager'
        },
        {
          label: 'Businessman',
          value: 'businessman'
        }
      ]
    },
    additionalInfo: {
      type: 'string',
      uniforms: {
        component: LongTextField
      }
    }
  },
  required: ['firstName', 'lastName']
};
```

What's changed is that now we've included the available options inside the `profession` property definition -
uniforms are smart enough to deduce result field type, thanks to the [`AutoField` algorithm](uth-autofield-algorithm).
When it comes to the `additionalInfo`, there is a slightly different approach applied - we can explicitly tell the `AutoForm` what field should be rendered.
Just don't forget to import the desired one!

The resulting form remains very the same:

<TutorialForm>
  <GuestFormWithFieldsInSchema />
</TutorialForm>
