import FormContainer from './components/FormContainer.js';
import GuestForm5 from './components/GuestForm5.js';

We already know something about our guests, but it's not that much really, so let's ask them a few more things!
In order to provide the best content at our meeting, we want to know what's the profession of our participants.
It would be also a decent idea to gather their visions and opinions.

To do so, we have to modify our schema.

TODO dodac do schemy `notes` i `profession`. pokazac jak zrobic ze zwyklego TextFielda(z auto!) explicite long textfield i uzycie selecta w formularzu. doadtkowo zrobic to samo przy pomocy schemy.

Sometimes we can't rely on the `AutoField` algorithm and have to directly provide our desired field.
We can use predefined [fields](api-fields.md) provided by uniforms.

### Replacing `AutoForm` fields

In the snippet below we've replaced generic `AutoField` components from the prevoius chapter with the specialized ones: `TextField` and `NumField`.

```js
import AutoForm from 'uniforms-unstyled/AutoForm';
import ErrorField from 'uniforms-unstyled/ErrorField';
import NumField from 'uniforms-unstyled/NumField';
import React from 'react';
import SubmitField from 'uniforms-unstyled/SubmitField';
import TextField from 'uniforms-unstyled/TextField';

import GuestSchema from './GuestSchema';

export default function GuestForm() {
  return (
    <AutoForm schema={GuestSchema} onSubmit={onSubmit}>
      <h4>IT meeting guest questionnaire</h4>
      <TextField name="lastName" />
      <ErrorField name="lastName" />
      <TextField name="firstName" />
      <ErrorField name="firstName" />
      <span>Do you want to share your work experience with us?</span>
      <NumField name="workExperience" />
      <ErrorField name="workExperience" />
      <SubmitField />
    </AutoForm>
  );
}
```

As you can see the result form remains very the same:

<FormContainer>
  <GuestForm5 />
</FormContainer>

### Manipulating the schema
