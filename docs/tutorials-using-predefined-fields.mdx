import GuestForm7 from './components/GuestForm7.js';

Now that we know how to ask our guests for their name, let's ask them a few more things!
We can expect a lot of different people coming to our IT conference - they could be developers, testers, product owners, project managers, businessmen and so on.
Perhaps we want to calculate how many representatives of various professions will visit us?
Or maybe (if there are enough people) we want to prepare special, personalized events?
It would be also a decent idea to somehow gather their visions and expectations about the conference or any additional valuable information for the organizer.

Let's modify our schema by adding two new properties: `profession` and `additionalInfo` in order to have the additional fields rendered:

```js
const schema = {
  title: 'Guest',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    firstName: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    lastName: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    workExperience: {
      description: 'Work experience in years',
      type: 'integer',
      minimum: 0,
      maximum: 100
    },
    profession: {
      type: 'string'
    },
    additionalInfo: {
      type: 'string'
    }
  },
  required: ['firstName', 'lastName']
};
```

After the schema change, we must not forget to add the fields to our form.
We will add the `profession` field above the `workExperience` field and the `additionalInfo` at the bottom:

```js
import AutoField from 'uniforms-unstyled/AutoField';
import AutoForm from 'uniforms-unstyled/AutoForm';
import ErrorField from 'uniforms-unstyled/ErrorField';
import React from 'react';
import SubmitField from 'uniforms-unstyled/SubmitField';

import GuestSchema from './GuestSchema';

export default function GuestForm() {
  return (
    <AutoForm schema={GuestSchema} onSubmit={console.log}>
      <h4>IT meeting guest questionnaire</h4>
      <AutoField name="lastName" />
      <ErrorField name="lastName">
        <span>You have to provide your last name!</span>
      </ErrorField>
      <AutoField name="firstName" />
      <ErrorField name="firstName" errorMessage="You have to provide your first name!" />
      <span>Do you want to share your work experience with us?</span>
      <AutoField name="profession" />
      <AutoField name="workExperience" />
      <ErrorField
        name="workExperience"
        errorMessage="Your work experience cannot be lesser than 0 or greater than 100 years!"
      />
      <AutoField name="additionalInfo" />
      <SubmitField />
    </AutoForm>
  );
}
```

<FormContainer>
  <GuestForm6 />
</FormContainer>

Let's stop for a while and think of what we have. Obviously, we there is a form generated, but it's not quite what we've expected:

- The `profession` field is rendered a an ordinary text input, where anyone can type literally anything.
  It would be far better if it would be displayed as a selectable list of options.
- The `additionalInfo` property is supposed to store lots of text, so it's preffered to be displayed as a text area.

**We can handle it in two ways:**

1. by replacing the `AutoField` inside the `AutoForm` with a desired field
2. by manipulating the schema using the `uniforms` key

### 1. Replacing the `AutoField`

### 2. Manipulating the schema
