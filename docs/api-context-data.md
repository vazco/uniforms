Some components might need to know a current form state, which is passed as [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
Properties stored in the context relates either to the form values or the form instance itself.
That means, besides current form state, you can access form methods or encounter some metadata, e.g. about the used schema.
Some of them were designed for internal use, but you can still take advantage of them.

## Accessing context data

A direct way of accessing the context data is to use the [`useForm`](/docs/api-helpers/#useform) hook:

```tsx
import { useForm } from 'uniforms';

function Example() {
  const context = useForm();
}
```

For convenience, it's also accessible through the [`useField`](/docs/api-helpers/#usefield) hook:

```tsx
import { useField } from 'uniforms';

function Example(rawProps) {
  const [props, context] = useField(rawProps.name, rawProps);
}
```

## Available context data

### `changed`

Indicates whether there was a change on form.

### `changedMap`

A map of changed fields. Rather internal one, used for checking if _other_ fields has changed.

### `error`

An object with a `details` field, which is an array of any validation errors.

### `formRef`

Contains reference to the form component that gives access to [the form methods](/docs/api-forms#methods).

### `model`

An object with current form fields values structured `{field: value}`.

### `name`

It is an array of the parent fields names:

```tsx
<Field name="x">
  // name = []
  <Field name="y.z">
    // name = ['x']
    <Field name="a" /> // name = ['x', 'y', 'z']
  </Field>
</Field>
```

For example if we define a `CompositeField`:

```tsx
const Composite = () => (
  <section>
    <AutoField name="firstName" />
    <AutoField name="lastName" />
  </section>
);
```

And use it like that:

```tsx
<AutoForm schema={schema}>
  <CompositeField name="personA" />
  <SubmitField />
</AutoForm>
```

The `name` array of the nested `AutoFields` will store a `personA` value.

### `onChange`

You can directly access to the `onChange` method. E.g. `onChange(field, value)`.

### `onSubmit`

Access to `onSubmit` method.

### `randomId`

Access to `randomId` method, created using the [`randomIds()`](/docs/api-helpers#randomids) helper.

### `schema`

A bridge class instance with `schema` and `validator` properties.

The `schema` is simply your schema object and `validator` is your validating function.

### `state`

The `state` is an object representing your current form status.

The state properties are:

|       Name        |                     Description                      |
| :---------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |
|    `disabled`     |       Indicates whether the form is disabled.        |
|    `readOnly`     |       Indicates whether the form is read-only.       |
| `showInlineError` | Indicates whether the inline errors should be shown. |

### `submitted`

Indicates whether the form was submitted.

### `submitting`

Indicates whether the form is in the `submitting` state. Helpful when handling asynchronous submission.

### `validating`

Indicates whether the form is in the `validating` state. Helpful when handling asynchronous validation.
