## Forms concept

There’s a very interesting class-based inheritance concept for forms.
Basically, there are a few types of forms with different capabilities.
Most of the time you’ll be using either AutoForm or ValidatedForm, but there are quite a few more to choose from:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/uniforms-graph.svg"
    alt="AutoForm class inheritance from ValidatedQuickForm which subsequently inherits from QuickForm and ValidatedForm."
  />
</p>

> **If you are not familiar with concept of HOC, read one of many posts about them first.**
> I’m sure you’ve read at least one of _Why ES6 classes are bad_ or _class considered harmful_ posts. I’ve read them too, so why is uniforms using classes? Well, it’s all about the complexity.

> I wanted to achieve the same functionality as with multiple HOCs, but within one component. To be honest, readability is more important than performance. In short, I’ve reached (more or less) traits with ES6 classes. The result?

```tsx
import BaseForm from './BaseForm';
import QuickForm from './QuickForm';
import ValidatedForm from './ValidatedForm';

const ValidatedQuickForm = ValidatedForm.Validated(QuickForm.Quick(BaseForm));
```

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/uniforms-traits.png"
    alt='Single AutoValidatedQuickSemanticForm component (using 5 "traits") viewed in React DevTools.'
  />
</p>

While it’s not a universal approach that will work in every situation, using it in uniforms allows us to deliver clean-looking components while keeping extensibility and separation of concerns.
