Imagine that we host an IT conference and want to make a list of guests.
Obviously, we want to collect their first name and last name.
Additionally, we can ask for their work experience, but that information is not required.
Let's prepare a form for the guests, so they can sign up for our event, by using uniforms!

### 1. Install the required packages

To start using uniforms, we have to install three independent packages:

1. Core
2. Bridge
3. Theme

In this example, we will use the JSONSchema to describe our desired data format and style our form using Semantic UI theme.

```shell
npm install uniforms
npm install uniforms-bridge-json-schema
npm install uniforms-semantic
```

**Note**: When using a themed package, remember to include correct styles! If you are willing to run this example by yourself,
have a read on [Semantic UI React's theme usage](https://react.semantic-ui.com/usage/#theme).

### 2. Start by defining a schema

After we've installed required packages, it's time to define our Guest schema. We can do it in a plain JSON, which is a valid JSONSchema instance:

<CodeSection
  language="js"
  section="schema"
  source={require('!!raw-loader!./examples/Tutorial/GuestSchema')}
/>

As you can see, we've defined three properties - `firstName` and `lastName`, that are of string type, and `workExperience`,
which is an integer, with a value between 0 and 100.

### 3. Then create the bridge

Now that we have the schema, we can create the uniforms bridge of it, by using the corresponding uniforms schema-to-bridge package.
Creating the bridge instance is necessary - without it, uniforms would not be able to process form generation and validation.
As we are using the JSONSchema, we have to import the `uniforms-bridge-json-schema` package.

<CodeSection
  language="js"
  section="bridgeImport"
  source={require('!!raw-loader!./examples/Tutorial/GuestSchema')}
/>

Now you may think that we can simply do:

```js
// Wrong usage of the JSONSchemaBridge!
// You have to pass a validator!
const bridge = new JSONSchemaBridge(schema);
```

However, **there's small caveat with using the JSONSchemaBridge**.
Because of its simplicity, JSONSchema doesn't provide any validation checkers, so in order to properly validate our submitted data,
we need to **manually define a validator**, and that is required by the uniforms `JSONSchemaBrigde` constructor.

To manually create the validator, we will use the [ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) package:

<CodeSection
  language="js"
  section="validator"
  source={require('!!raw-loader!./examples/Tutorial/GuestSchema')}
/>

Now that we have both the schema and the validator, we can create the uniforms bridge:

<CodeSection
  language="js"
  section="bridge"
  source={require('!!raw-loader!./examples/Tutorial/GuestSchema')}
/>

Just to recap, the whole `GuestSchema.js` file looks like this:

<CodeSection
  language="js"
  replace={{ '//.*?\n': '' }}
  source={require('!!raw-loader!./examples/Tutorial/GuestSchema')}
/>

### 4. Finally, use it in a form!

Uniforms theme packages provide the `AutoForm` component, which is able to generate the form based on the given schema.
All we have to do now is to pass the previously created GuestSchema to the `AutoForm`:

<CodeSection
  language="js"
  replace={{ "'[^']*?/universal'": "'uniforms-semantic'" }}
  source={require('!!raw-loader!./examples/Tutorial/GuestFormBasic')}
/>

And that's it! `AutoForm` will generate a complete form with labeled fields, errors list (if any) and a submit button.
Also, it will take care of validation and handle model changes.

<TutorialForm>
  <GuestFormBasic />
</TutorialForm>
