## ValidatedForm

```js
import ValidatedForm from 'uniforms/ValidatedForm'; // Or from the theme package.

<ValidatedForm
  // Additional asynchronous validation.
  //   Schema validation has to be sync, so this is the only way to achieve
  //   async validation.
  onValidate={(model, error, callback) => {
    // You can either ignore validation error...
    if (omitValidation(model)) {
      return callback(null);
    }

    // ...or any additional validation if an error is already there...
    if (error) {
      return callback();
    }

    // ...or feed it with another error.
    MyAPI.validate(model, error => callback(error || null));
  }}
  // Validation mode.
  //   By default, the form will start to validate from the time of the first
  //   submit and then revalidate on every change. It's 'onChangeAfterSubmit'.
  //   There are also 'onChange' and 'onSubmit' modes, but those are quite
  //   self-explanatory.
  validate="onChangeAfterSubmit"
  // Validator options.
  //   It's passed to getValidator of your schema bridge. It really depends on
  //   your schema.
  validator={{clean: true}}
  // Form methods.
  ref={form => {
    // Validate form with the current model.
    //   Returns a Promise, which rejects with an validation error or
    //   resolves without any value. Note, that it resolves/rejects AFTER
    //   the component is rerendered.
    form.validate();

    // Validate form with key set to value.
    //   You can use it to check, if a given value will pass the
    //   validation or not. Returns validation Promise, as described above.
    form.validate(key, value);

    // Validate form with the given model.
    //   Rather internal function. Returns validation Promise, as described
    //   above.
    form.validateModel(model);
  }}
/>;
```

**Note:** All `BaseForm` props are also accepted and all methods are available.
