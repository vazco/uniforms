# `BaseField`

```js
import BaseField from 'uniforms/BaseField';

// You can't really render a BaseField because it doesn't have a render method.
// It's a base class of all packaged fields, so that all props below are available
// to all fields.
<BaseField
    // Field disabled state.
    //   It's passed directly to the field, but it propagates same as the label.
    disabled={false}

    // Field label.
    //   This prop has three modes. If you pass a string, then it will be used
    //   as a label. If you pass a null, then it won't have a label, but nested
    //   fields will have default labels. If you pass a non-null falsy value, it
    //   won't have a label and nested fields won't have labels too.
    label={true}

    // Field name.
    //   Used for identification. It should match your schema - if not, it will
    //   throw an error.
    name="field"

    // Field placeholder.
    //   If set to true, then a label will be used. Otherwise, it's handled like
    //   a label (including propagation).
    placeholder={false}

    // Field value.
    //   Every field accepts its specific value type only.
    value={/* accepted value */}

    // You can pass any prop but remember that passing onChange will "detach"
    // the field from the form in some way - it won't change your form state.
    // Also, passing any already provided prop - like id - will override the
    // default one.
/>
