## AutoForm

```js
import AutoForm from 'uniforms/AutoForm'; // Or from the theme package.

<AutoForm
    // Like onChange but for the whole model.
    //   Triggered just after onChange but with the next model instead of
    //   (key, value) pair.
    onChangeModel={model => console.log(model)}
/>
```

**Note:** All `ValidatedQuickForm` props are also accepted and all methods are available.
